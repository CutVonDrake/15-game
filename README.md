# 15 Puzzle Game

A simple implementation of the 15 Puzzle game, where the goal is to arrange the tiles in numerical order by sliding them around.

## How to Play

- The game board consists of a grid of tiles, with one empty space.
- The tiles are shuffled, and the player must slide them using the empty space until the tiles are arranged in numerical order (starting from 1, top-left to bottom-right).
- The game ends when the tiles are in the correct order, and the player can choose to play again.

## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to slide the tiles:
  - **Up Arrow**: Move a tile up.
  - **Down Arrow**: Move a tile down.
  - **Left Arrow**: Move a tile left.
  - **Right Arrow**: Move a tile right.
  
- After winning, you can choose to either play again by pressing **Y** or exit the game by pressing **N**.

## Features

- Fully functional 15 Puzzle game.
- Supports multiple grid sizes based on user input (for both rows and columns).
- Displays the time taken to complete the game.
- Visually distinct borders around tiles and the game screen.
